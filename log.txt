Tasks: not sure if I understood the instruction perfectly, I opted to create 2 different forms with one for post and one for get.

Tasks: finished the timestable, took a lot longer than i thought, lots of error checking, display is not as neat as I would like.
Need to polish it up, maybe change up syntax of the html <tr> and <td>s.

Tasks: Extremely frustrated, the forms were all displaing great but now nothing displays, just a blank page. Even when I do view
source it gives a blank page as well. Tried in IE and still the same thing, when using view source it shows the html, head, and body
tags but no actual html code...
